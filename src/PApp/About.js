            <p id="para">Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Science in my high school and got introduced to programming at Lovely Professional University after getting admission into Btech CSE . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms. Most importantly I'm a Problem Solver.
            I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2024) with 8.35 CGPA. Also I've knowledge of Front End Web Development and created some projects on that using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, and UI/UX.
